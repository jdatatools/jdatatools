You are about to receive a single text input containing the combined content of multiple files: Java code files (.java) and XML configuration files (.xml). Each file's content is separated by blank lines, and file boundaries are marked with comments (Java-style `//--- START FILE...`, `//--- END FILE...` for Java, and XML-style `<!----- START FILE... -->`, `<!----- END FILE... -->` for XML).

Your task is to analyze and potentially modify these files based on my subsequent instructions.

**When responding, please analyze each file and decide whether it should be CREATED, UPDATED, REMOVED, or remain UNCHANGED.**

**For each file, explicitly indicate your intended action using the following format *within the file marker comments*:**

*   **CREATE:**  If the file should be created (it doesn't exist in the original context), use:
    `//--- START FILE: [file path] (JAVA) - CREATE ---` or `<!----- START FILE: [file path] (XML) - CREATE --- -->`
    and `//--- END FILE: [file path] - CREATE ---` or `<!----- END FILE: [file path] - CREATE --- -->`
    and include the complete content of the new file.

*   **UPDATE:** If the file should be updated (it exists and needs modification), use:
    `//--- START FILE: [file path] (JAVA) - UPDATE ---` or `<!----- START FILE: [file path] (XML) - UPDATE --- -->`
    and `//--- END FILE: [file path] - UPDATE ---` or `<!----- END FILE: [file path] - UPDATE --- -->`
    and include the complete and entire content of the modified file.

*   **REMOVE:** If the file should be removed (deleted), use:
    `//--- START FILE: [file path] (JAVA) - REMOVE ---` or `<!----- START FILE: [file path] (XML) - REMOVE --- -->`
    and `//--- END FILE: [file path] - REMOVE ---` or `<!----- END FILE: [file path] - REMOVE --- -->`
    **Do not include any file content for REMOVE actions.**

*   **UNCHANGED:** If the file should remain unchanged, use:
    `No changes to: [file path]`

**If you modify or create multiple files, or indicate removals, please include the complete information for *all* files (created, updated, removed, unchanged) in *one single, comprehensive output response**.  Ensure that for CREATE and UPDATE actions, you provide the complete file content. For REMOVE actions, do not include file content.

**If you believe that explanations of your actions would be helpful, please provide them, but ensure that any explanations are placed *after* all file action indications (CREATE, UPDATE, REMOVE, UNCHANGED) and code blocks.**

**Separate the explanations from the file actions and code output using a clear separator, such as "--- EXPLANATIONS ---" or "### EXPLANATIONS ###".**

The code output for CREATE and UPDATE actions should be formatted for easy copy-pasting back into files.
