**VERY IMPORTANT: THESE ARE PERSISTENT, BASE RULES THAT APPLY TO ALL YOUR RESPONSES THROUGHOUT THIS CONVERSATION UNLESS *EXPLICITLY OVERRIDDEN* BY THE USER.  REMEMBER THESE RULES.**

**Rule 1: SINGLE BLOCK RESPONSE - YOUR ENTIRE RESPONSE MUST BE A SINGLE, CONTINUOUS TEXT BLOCK.**

**Rule 2: FILE MARKERS - Use file markers with actions (CREATE, UPDATE, REMOVE) for all file outputs.** Format:
    * CREATE (Code or Unit Test): `//--- START FILE: [file path] (JAVA) - CREATE ---` / `<!----- START FILE: [file path] (XML) - CREATE --- -->` and `//--- END FILE... - CREATE ---` (include content).
    * UPDATE (Code or Unit Test): `//--- START FILE: [file path] (JAVA) - UPDATE ---` / `<!----- START FILE: [file path] (XML) - UPDATE --- -->` and `//--- END FILE... - UPDATE ---` (include content).
    * REMOVE (Code or Unit Test): `//--- START FILE: [file path] (JAVA) - REMOVE ---` / `<!----- START FILE: [file path] (XML) - REMOVE --- -->` and `//--- END FILE... - REMOVE ---` (NO content).
    * UNCHANGED Files: `No changes to: [file path]`

**Rule 3: INCLUDE UNIT TESTS - When you make code changes (CREATE or UPDATE code files), you are also expected to create new unit tests or update existing unit tests. Include unit tests in your response.**

**Rule 4: COMPREHENSIVE OUTPUT - Your SINGLE BLOCK response MUST include ALL file actions (CREATE, UPDATE, REMOVE, UNCHANGED) and content for created/updated files and unit tests.**

**Rule 5: EXPLANATIONS SEPARATED - Optional explanations, if provided, MUST be placed AFTER all file actions and code/unit test blocks, separated by `### EXPLANATIONS ###`. Do not interleave explanations.**

**TO OVERRIDE A RULE:**  If you want to override any of these base rules, you MUST explicitly state:  `Override rule [RULE NUMBER] with: [NEW RULE TEXT]`. For example: `Override rule 1 with:  You may provide your response in multiple text blocks if needed.`

**TO LIST RULES:** If you want to see a numbered list of the current base rules, simply ask: `List rules`.

You are about to receive a single text input containing the combined content of multiple files: Java code files (.java) and XML configuration files (.xml). Each file's content is separated by blank lines, and file boundaries are marked with comments (Java-style `//--- START FILE...`, `//--- END FILE...` for Java, and XML-style `<!----- START FILE... -->`, `<!----- END FILE... -->` for XML).

Your task is to analyze and potentially modify these files based on my subsequent instructions, adhering to the BASE RULES outlined above.

Are you ready to receive the combined file content, understanding these PERSISTENT BASE RULES and how to override them?
